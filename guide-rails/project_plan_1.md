#### **Story 1.8a: Critical Bug Fixes & Polish** üîß **IN PROGRESS**
**Status:** Addressing critical functionality issues

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix audio file not persisting on page refresh/update
- [ ] Fix microphone input not triggering visualizations properly
- [ ] Remove microphone audio feedback (input only, no speaker output)
- [ ] Verify preset system is fully removed
- [ ] Fix tags not persisting to database
- [ ] Add tag validation (15 char limit, no URLs, edge cases)
- [ ] Fix visualization initial responsiveness (immediate trigger on play)
- [ ] Fix requirement to switch inputs to trigger visualizations

**Completed:**
- [x] Keyboard component functional and triggering visualizations
- [x] Fixed dropdown z-index clipping issues
- [x] Keyboard notes stop properly on release

**Technical Notes:**
- Audio file persistence may need blob storage integration
- Microphone should only capture input, not route to speakers
- Visualization triggering should be automatic on audio play
- Tag validation should include sanitization and length limits

## Current Blockers & Resolutions

### **High Priority**
1. **Audio File Persistence** - Uploaded audio files not surviving page refresh
   - *Resolution Path:* Implement proper blob storage or base64 encoding for audio data
2. **Microphone Feedback Loop** - Microphone input causing audio feedback through speakers
   - *Resolution Path:* Disable audio output for microphone input, visualization only
3. **Visualization Responsiveness** - Requires input switching to trigger visualizations
   - *Resolution Path:* Fix event listeners and initialization sequence

### **Medium Priority**  
1. **Tag Persistence** - Tags not saving to database properly
   - *Resolution Path:* Debug save operation and ensure proper data structure
2. **Tag Validation** - Need input sanitization and limits
   - *Resolution Path:* Implement validation rules (15 char, no URLs, etc.)
